    <p>Throughout September until the middle of October, I have completed 16 DataCamp courses with success, while learning a lot through participating in those online courses. Especially the sessions, in which you could try coding something yourself after learning about a new topic were fun and helpful to understand the subject better.</p>
    <p>Therefore, in the following, screenshots of all required and successfully completed DataCamp courses are displayed:</p>

  <summary>Introduction of the Subject Field</summary> 
    <p>The first information given about the project <i>Motoric</i> was the project description. Which stated as follows: <br> <br><i>Within the Start(V)aardig project several information is gathered among more than 1700 young children. Actual motor competence, perceived motor competence, enjoyment, BMI, age, gender and several factors related to the parenting style are gathered at two different moments (T0 and T1). The assignment is to detect which variables predict a (long term) low and concerning level of motor competence in young children. If we are able to detect a certain ‘risk profile’ at an early stage we (BSC, PE teachers) can provide them appropriate interventions.</i><br><br>
    From this description only basic knowledge about the project and it's subject could have been gathered. Therefore, research was done to gain a better understanding of the topic and the given problem that needed to be solved.<br>
    First, it was interesting to know more about the organization <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a> to explore their specification in order to create a connection to why this particular problem statement arised and this project was started. <br>
    Therefore, within <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a>, this project was created in order to try to recognize difficulties in the motor skills development in a young child at a very young stage, so that possible following misdevelopments in the child's motor capabilities can - with a high chance - be prevented or at least better helped with, before it is too late and the child will need a great amount of help to correct and enhance their motor skills or cannot be really helped anymore to improve, but at least can be helped to slow down or stop the process of worsening. <br> 
    To gather more information on the topic of motor skills development in young children, more research has been conducted, resulting in the following findings, that are described and listed under the following point 'Background Research'.</p>
      <ul>
        <details>
          <summary>Background Research</summary>
          <p>During the background research about the topic of the motor skills development in young children, a basic idea the process of that development could be concluded, where the development of the gross motor skills was the main focus.<br>
          Therefore, at the age of two, a child for example be able to pick up objects from a standing position and not lose his balance, kick a ball, walk and run. At the age of three, shortly balancing and hopping on one foot, pedalling a tricycle and walking upstairs with switching feet, should not be a problem. When the child is four years old, it is expected that he can throw a ball overhand while coordinating that movement and in general show an enhanced balance contorl. At the age of five, coordinating the entire body, therefore hopping, jumping and skipping without losing balance, and keeping the balance while standing on one foot with both eyes closed, should not be a difficulty (<a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-lifespandevelopment/chapter/motor-skill-development/">Motor Skill Development</a>). As similarly when the child becomes six years old, he should be able to walk on a balance beam, hopping a good distance, run on toes, skip with the use of a skipping rope, throw and catch in a mature way and jump with mature control and skills (<a href="https://childdevelopment.com.au/resources/child-development-charts/gross-motor-developmental-chart/">Gross Motor Development Chart</a>).</p>

        <summary>Existing, Similar Projects</summary>
          <p>After gathering more background information on the subject of motor skills development in young children, related works, such as projects, were of interest to find. These, even if not dealing with the exact same problem statement can help getting a broder viewpoint on our own project and give us ideas of where and how to start.<br>
          Therefore, a search for such similar already existing projects was undertaken through which several findings have been made. These findings are listed under the point 'List of papers from existing projects'.<br><br>
          In most of the gathered studies, the children were between three and six years old, while some of the studies dealt with the gross and other with fine motor skills developed, and some with both of them.<br>
          For instance, a demonstration of a similarity to our study could be found in studies such as from <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methodshttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methods">Wang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://efsupit.ro/images/stories/3%20September2016/art%20175.pdf">Abdullah et al. (2016)</a>, in which children were tested with the help of different physical exercises in order to estimate their state of motor competence, just as in our study physical exercises were used as a testing method as well. The investigation of many different variables or rather features that characterize the children, their background and other related details, along with the importance of each individual feature, is another similarity between some of the existing studies and our project <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3345234">(Gilbert, 1980b; de Meester et al., 2020b)</a>. Further, in the study from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01336-2">Meester et al (2020c)</a>, a differentiation between perceived and actual motor competence was made and explored, which is also the case in our study, since perceived and actual motor competence are kept seperately. Studies like the ones from <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methodshttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methods">Wang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899107/">Zysset et al. (2018)</a> were of interest as well because they include and/or evaluate parental questionnaires or rather surveys, which are incorporated in our study too.<br>
          Some studies took different and rather technical approaches to conduct their reseach on the motor capabilities of young children. Such studies exemplarily developed and used a smart play device (<a href="https://digitallifecentre.nl/redactie/resources/finalpaperfinal.pdf">Sander et al, unknown</a>), smart toys (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b862/333190b6a202c1dd8c14ed8821ae3c3fb9a4.pdf">Martin-Ruiz et al., 2015</a>), sensor-augmented toys (<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e24237">Brons et al., 2021</a>) and a web-based application (<a href="http://journal.unj.ac.id/unj/index.php/jpud/article/view/10371">Chairilsyah, 2019</a>).<br><br>
          In conclusion, all of these studies give knowledge and an interesting insight into the motor skills development topic, while at the same time also provide a basic understanding in that sphere. This is of great use and help for our rather new study, which tackles to find a solution to a problem that has never been dealt with in any study before. Therefore, it was our challenge to find an answer to how to predict the motor skills development in young children.</p>

          <summary>Existing Datasets</summary>
          <p>Finding an exisiting dataset was not a necessity for this project because two datasets already existed, since the data had been gathered by <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a> and was given us to work with.<br> However, we did not receive those datasets immediately, for which reason I researched for existing similar datasets on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"><i>Kaggle</i></a>. During that research, I found one dataset that seemed to examine a similar topic. That particular dataset looks at the growth development from child- to adulthood, while several growth related measurements were taken, as well as information was gathered from the individual child's parents. I found that two of the taken measurements were about motor skills. Therefore, one of the measurements were the gross and the other the fine motor skills. <br>
          However, I decided against indulding deeper into this dataset because we soon received the first part of the first dataset from our project owner.</p>

          <summary>Data Collection</summary>
            <p>Since the data was given to us by StartVaardig through our project owner Pim Koolwijk, we did not have to collect the data ourselves. However, we received the data in bits, time after time, which meant that we had to put together the different data files every time new data arrived.
            <br>
            Unfortunately, the data files cannot be shared because the information contained in those files was trusted to our group by our project owner.</p>
            <p>Because the data that was given to us, had a rather small amount of participants that were in our targeted age group of four to six years old and contained complete information about them, we decided to search for fitting CBS data that might help us to gain a larger amount of data to be able to create rather accurate predictions later on. The CBS data we gathered contained information on core numbers, gender and age, income and the migration background. 
            <br>In the end however, we decided that the data would not be as useful to us in order to make good predictions, and since it did cause great problems while merging the datasets together, we decided to not use the CBS data afterall.</p>

    <p>In the communication part of this project, I have held two internal and one external presentation, prepared and/or helped prepare the slides for the presentations, created the design and layout of the slides and Kahoot quiz for the learning lab. I also worked on the research paper and wrote parts of it, as well as proofread and gave feedback to the parts my teammates composed. Also, I was always physically present during all presentations to support my teammate(s), who was or were giving the presentation and to react towards questions or feedback from the audience, even if I was not the one giving the presentation.<br>
    Folliwing, my contributions to this part wil be described more precisely:</p>

    <p>Throughout September until the middle of October, I have completed 16 DataCamp courses with success, while learning a lot through participating in those online courses. Especially the sessions, in which you could try coding something yourself after learning about a new topic were fun and helpful to understand the subject better.</p>
    <p>Therefore, in the following, screenshots of all required and successfully completed DataCamp courses are displayed:</p>

<!-- DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE -->
<details>
  <summary>Domain Knowledge</summary>
  <p>The first information given about the project <i>Motoric</i> was the project description. Which stated as follows: <br> <br><i>Within the Start(V)aardig project several information is gathered among more than 1700 young children. Actual motor competence, perceived motor competence, enjoyment, BMI, age, gender and several factors related to the parenting style are gathered at two different moments (T0 and T1). The assignment is to detect which variables predict a (long term) low and concerning level of motor competence in young children. If we are able to detect a certain ‘risk profile’ at an early stage we (BSC, PE teachers) can provide them appropriate interventions.</i><br><br>
  From this description only basic knowledge about the project and it's subject could have been gathered. Therefore, research was done to gain a better understanding of the topic and the given problem that needed to be solved.<br>
  First, it was interesting to know more about the organization <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a> to explore their specification in order to create a connection to why this particular problem statement arised and this project was started. <br>
  Therefore, within <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a>, this project was created in order to try to recognize difficulties in the motor skills development in a young child at a very young stage, so that possible following misdevelopments in the child's motor capabilities can - with a high chance - be prevented or at least better helped with, before it is too late and the child will need a great amount of help to correct and enhance their motor skills or cannot be really helped anymore to improve, but at least can be helped to slow down or stop the process of worsening. <br> 
  To gather more information on the topic of motor skills development in young children, more research has been conducted, resulting in the following findings, that are described and listed under the following point 'Background Research'.      
  </p>
    <ul>
    <details>
          <summary>Background Research</summary>
          <p>During the background research about the topic of the motor skills development in young children, a basic idea the process of that development could be concluded, where the development of the gross motor skills was the main focus.<br>
          Therefore, at the age of two, a child for example be able to pick up objects from a standing position and not lose his balance, kick a ball, walk and run. At the age of three, shortly balancing and hopping on one foot, pedalling a tricycle and walking upstairs with switching feet, should not be a problem. When the child is four years old, it is expected that he can throw a ball overhand while coordinating that movement and in general show an enhanced balance contorl. At the age of five, coordinating the entire body, therefore hopping, jumping and skipping without losing balance, and keeping the balance while standing on one foot with both eyes closed, should not be a difficulty (<a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-lifespandevelopment/chapter/motor-skill-development/">Motor Skill Development</a>). As similarly when the child becomes six years old, he should be able to walk on a balance beam, hopping a good distance, run on toes, skip with the use of a skipping rope, throw and catch in a mature way and jump with mature control and skills (<a href="https://childdevelopment.com.au/resources/child-development-charts/gross-motor-developmental-chart/">Gross Motor Development Chart</a>).</p>

          <summary>Existing, Similar Projects</summary>
          <p>After gathering more background information on the subject of motor skills development in young children, related works, such as projects, were of interest to find. These, even if not dealing with the exact same problem statement can help getting a broder viewpoint on our own project and give us ideas of where and how to start.<br>
          Therefore, a search for such similar already existing projects was undertaken through which several findings have been made. These findings are listed under the point 'List of papers from existing projects'.<br><br>
          In most of the gathered studies, the children were between three and six years old, while some of the studies dealt with the gross and other with fine motor skills developed, and some with both of them.<br>
          For instance, a demonstration of a similarity to our study could be found in studies such as from <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methodshttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methods">Wang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://efsupit.ro/images/stories/3%20September2016/art%20175.pdf">Abdullah et al. (2016)</a>, in which children were tested with the help of different physical exercises in order to estimate their state of motor competence, just as in our study physical exercises were used as a testing method as well. The investigation of many different variables or rather features that characterize the children, their background and other related details, along with the importance of each individual feature, is another similarity between some of the existing studies and our project <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3345234">(Gilbert, 1980b; de Meester et al., 2020b)</a>. Further, in the study from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01336-2">Meester et al (2020c)</a>, a differentiation between perceived and actual motor competence was made and explored, which is also the case in our study, since perceived and actual motor competence are kept seperately. Studies like the ones from <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methodshttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methods">Wang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899107/">Zysset et al. (2018)</a> were of interest as well because they include and/or evaluate parental questionnaires or rather surveys, which are incorporated in our study too.<br>
          Some studies took different and rather technical approaches to conduct their reseach on the motor capabilities of young children. Such studies exemplarily developed and used a smart play device (<a href="https://digitallifecentre.nl/redactie/resources/finalpaperfinal.pdf">Sander et al, unknown</a>), smart toys (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b862/333190b6a202c1dd8c14ed8821ae3c3fb9a4.pdf">Martin-Ruiz et al., 2015</a>), sensor-augmented toys (<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e24237">Brons et al., 2021</a>) and a web-based application (<a href="http://journal.unj.ac.id/unj/index.php/jpud/article/view/10371">Chairilsyah, 2019</a>).<br><br>
          In conclusion, all of these studies give knowledge and an interesting insight into the motor skills development topic, while at the same time also provide a basic understanding in that sphere. This is of great use and help for our rather new study, which tackles to find a solution to a problem that has never been dealt with in any study before. Therefore, it was our challenge to find an answer to how to predict the motor skills development in young children.</p>

          <summary>Existing Datasets</summary>
          <p>Finding an exisiting dataset was not a necessity for this project because two datasets already existed, since the data had been gathered by <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a> and was given us to work with.<br> However, we did not receive those datasets immediately, for which reason I researched for existing similar datasets on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"><i>Kaggle</i></a>. During that research, I found one dataset that seemed to examine a similar topic. That particular dataset looks at the growth development from child- to adulthood, while several growth related measurements were taken, as well as information was gathered from the individual child's parents. I found that two of the taken measurements were about motor skills. Therefore, one of the measurements were the gross and the other the fine motor skills. <br>
          However, I decided against indulding deeper into this dataset because we soon received the first part of the first dataset from our project owner.</p>

<!-- DATA COLLECTION -->
<details>
  <summary>Data Collection</summary>
    <p>Since the data was given to us by StartVaardig through our project owner Pim Koolwijk, we did not have to collect the data ourselves. However, we received the data in bits, time after time, which meant that we had to put together the different data files every time new data arrived.
    <br>
    Unfortunately, the data files cannot be shared because the information contained in those files was trusted to our group by our project owner.</p>
    <p>Because the data that was given to us, had a rather small amount of participants that were in our targeted age group of four to six years old and contained complete information about them, we decided to search for fitting CBS data that might help us to gain a larger amount of data to be able to create rather accurate predictions later on. The CBS data we gathered contained information on core numbers, gender and age, income and the migration background. 
    <br>In the end however, we decided that the data would not be as useful to us in order to make good predictions, and since it did cause great problems while merging the datasets together, we decided to not use the CBS data afterall.</p>

    <p>In the communication part of this project, I have held two internal and one external presentation, prepared and/or helped prepare the slides for the presentations, created the design and layout of the slides and Kahoot quiz for the learning lab. I also worked on the research paper and wrote parts of it, as well as proofread and gave feedback to the parts my teammates composed. Also, I was always physically present during all presentations to support my teammate(s), who was or were giving the presentation and to react towards questions or feedback from the audience, even if I was not the one giving the presentation.<br>
    Folliwing, my contributions to this part wil be described more precisely:</p>

          <p>Using the design and layout from the slides I designed for the learning lab, Lisa and I created the slides for the third external presentation together. For that, we went through every slide together and discuss it's contents as well as design and layout. This presentation also included the <a href="/User Interface Wireframes/UserInterface_Wireframes_Idea.pdf">prototype of wireframes for a possible user interface</a> for our prediction model tool, which I created.</p>

          <p>Although I did not present the learning lab, I contributed to it by preparing the slides for it, which means I created the complete design and layout, as well as gave some input on possible content ideas and placements.</p>

          <p>Additionally, Lisa and I prepared the Kahoot Quiz for the learning lab in order to involve the audience directly in our presentation. Further we intended the quiz to be simple, though slightly tricky, but at the same time fun. <br> Following are screenshots of the Kahoot Quiz:</p>
