        <summary>Reflection on own contribution to the project</summary>
          <p>Throughout this semester, I have worked on the project ‘Motoric’ with my group consisting of Lisa, Pascal, Joost and Joep, while facing a lot of challenges, but also achieving accomplishments together. During the entire duration of the project, I have always actively participated and supported my group in any way it was possible for me. Therefore, I have always been present at meetings set with my group, the teachers and all presentations, and was unfortunately not able to attend just a few meetings, for which I always asked for an update, so that I would always be aware of anything that was going on in the project, at all times, and could participate fully. I also asked questions, when certain matters were unclear to me and reached out for help if I needed it, as well as helped and supported my teammates. I also participated in discussions and contributed with my thoughts on the given problems to aid with finding solutions for those problems together, and always took part in project planning, in which tasks were noted and assigned to each project member or smaller teams. The tasks that were assigned to me, I always tried to complete in the best possible way I could to allow our group to move forward in the project, while having intermediate results with which we could work on further.
          The background knowledge, I brought into the project was some experience with programming in different programming languages, but also especially on the web-development side and knowledge and experience on the UI and UX design. Since I had never worked with the programming language Python before this project, I completed all the required DataCamp courses to get some understanding and experience with Python, so I would be able to engage in the project. In the beginning of the project, I occupied myself with researching the project, such as gaining background knowledge on the topic of motor skills in young children, but also finding various already existing projects that somewhat were similar and related to our project. I also looked for existing datasets that might relate to our topic, however have found only one that was suiting the topic in some ways, although I decided not to indulge into that dataset because we soon received our dataset from our project owner from the project Start(V)aardig. Therefore, I then went through the to us given dataset and later also the following ones, gathered some overview over it and contributed especially to its cleaning part, while also removing outliers and handling NaN values and imputing some missing values. Visualizing the data, while for example comparing two datasets or the included features with each other, in order to get a better understanding of it, was also one of the contributions I made to the project. In addition, I researched predictive models and tried to implement some of them on our data to help with the selection of the best model for our project.
          Furthermore, I presented two internal and one external presentation, and helped preparing or prepared the slides for the presentations, which also included for example designing the design and layout, as well as possible content and its placement, for the learning lab, for which I also created together with one teammate a Kahoot quiz that intended to involve the audience in our learning lab directly. 
          Moreover, I participated in writing the paper and composed parts of it, while proofreading the entire paper and giving feedback to my teammates on their parts of the paper.
          And finally, I also created wireframes for a possible user interface that might be implemented for our prediction model tool.
          Resulting, I contributed in every part of the project. In some parts more and better than in others, but I always tried to put effort into all my contributions, and always be present and supportive for my group to help bringing the project forward and creating a nice atmosphere in the group.
          I have learned a lot of new things during this project and had to overcome challenges as the topics were new to me, where I handled some better than others, but all in all managed the difficulties.

        <summary>Reflection on own learning objectives</summary>
          <p>I learned a lot during this semester and while working on this project. First, I learned a new programming language Python, that I had never worked with before that. At the same time, this was my first encounter with data science, for what reason I had never dealt with this subject previously and had never worked on any similar project before. Only parts such as creating visualizations and graphs were familiar to me through previous courses I had taken. Therefore, I had never prepared datasets, nor worked with predictive models until this project. Thus, I gained a lot of new experiences and knowledge from this project. 
          While working with the datasets, I even gained some more knowledge on Microsoft Excel. But far more importantly, I understood how to work with data and different datasets, how to explore, clean and prepare them properly. Working with predictive models, was a new field for me as well, in which I learned how to configure, train and evaluate some of the predictive models that I have tried. Although I have not understood entirely how the each of the individual models or rather the algorithm they use, works, I understood the differences between the different models and which might be more useful in which situation. 
          Additionally, I practiced presenting in front of a larger group of people in person as well as digitally and practiced preparing the presentation and the slides for the presentation according to time limitations that were given for the presentations. 
          Furthermore, I made another new experience with working on a real project that is really needed in the real world and is not kept inside the university. Therefore, I also experienced how to encounter a real project owner, who needs the product of this project for his own ongoing project, and how to pose questions in a precise way, to help with the further conduction of this project.
          Moreover, I once again experienced working in a larger group of people, with whom steady coordination is needed to keep in check who is working on which task and how we can organize ourselves to work together efficiently. From that, working with Scrum was another new experience for me because I had never worked with Scrum before, but learned how it functions during this project. 
          All in all, I did gain many new and different experiences and knowledge throughout this project in different areas, while in some of them I resulted to be better at than others. But I broadened my horizon in terms of programming, data handling, making predictions with models, as well as in the communicational parts of this project.

  <summary>Evaluation on the group project as a whole</summary> 
    <p>The group project as a whole had its ups and downs. As I perceived it, it started very enthusiastically, while research has been done and I, like my teammates, got familiar with the project. Unfortunately, I experienced quite a long wait for the first dataset, which meant that our group project could not move further, but the focus was instead shifted on getting familiar with the new programming language and the subject data science in general. After receiving the first part of the dataset, I could finally try some of my newly acquired knowledge on the data, while also get an understanding of the data and prepare it, so that it could have been used in the predictive models.
    However, the main problem in our group project was that we did not receive all the data at once, but rather were sent it in bits, which we had to merge together several times and go through the data preparation process again and again. This was slowing down the continuation of our group project.
    I tried to contribute at each of those reoccurring moments in the best way I could, so that we would acquire new intermediate results with which we could work further. 
    At other times, it was not exactly clear to me and my teammates which next steps we needed to take in order to get closer to the result we wanted to achieve. However, we discussed these problems together and always found a way out of the situation that we were having.
    Besides, sometimes I did not have the impression that I had the complete understanding about who of my teammates was working on which task, for which reason I intervened and called in everybody from my group to a team meeting, where everyone told what they were currently working on, from where we could also recognize problems or the need to exchange the tasks or their priority. 
    All in all, although the group project sometimes did not run smoothly, we most of the times, managed to figure out solutions for are problems and move on further with our group project. Some things did not work out exactly as we planned in the beginning as well. For example, that we had the idea to implement a user interface for our prediction model tool, but unfortunately had to cross it out of our planning, since the given time frame did not allow the fulfillment of that task. 
    Nevertheless, we worked as a team at all times and had a great working atmosphere, which made it fun to work together on the group project.

<!-- RESEARCH PROJECT -->
<div><h3>Research Project<h3></div>
<details>
  <summary>Task Definition</summary> 
    <p>This project was started by the project Start(V)aardig as a reaction towards the general observation that young children at this day and age suffer more often from poor motor competence development due to the modern way of life in nowadays society. Children starting from a very young age are used to modern technologies which are incorporated in their play devices such as games and other, which leads to the consequences that children that grow up in these modern surroundings are less likely to go outside and play outdoors, as well as indulge into activities such as various sports, but rather stay at home most of the time and mostly sit while using a game device to spend their time. This leads to lack of movement, which increases the chance of that child to develop insufficient motor competence. As a consequence, the child might continue suffering from this underdevelopment up into his adulthood and may never recover, if he did not get proper help to work against the decreasing motor competence to improve his situation.
    Therefore, this project was motivated by the will to interfere in a child’s development process at the right moment, in order to be able to help children before the damage cannot be undone anymore. For that, it is important to detect negative changes in a child’s motor skills development at a very early stage, and in the best-case scenario, before the negative changes had the chance to appear, so that they can be prevented beforehand. However, children that already have decreased motor competence have to be detected just as well, so that they can, too, receive the appropriate treatment they need to try to enhance their motor skills again, or, in the wort-case scenario, if there is no chance of improvement, at least will be supported so that their motor skills won’t decrease further, but stay at the same level. 
    This leads to the problem definition of this project, which is predicting children’s motor competence level to understand which child might or will need help with developing or rather enhancing his motor skills. From that the following research question and the subquestions arose:
    </p>
    <div><h4><i>“How can data science be used to predict whether a child has a chance of developing a lack in motor skills a year later?”</i></h4></div>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Which biological and socio-demographic variables have an influence on the motoric skills development of children</p></li>
        <li><p>Which model has the lowest false negative rate?</p></li>
        <li><p>Which characteristics have the children with a lack in motor skills in common?</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>As the <b>main research question</b> states, the main goal of this project is to find a solution to how a chance of lacking motor skills in a child can be predicted in a timely future of a year later from the child’s starting observation age. Moreover, the prediction has to be made with the use of data science, for what it has to be explored how data science can be used in such manner.
    <br><br>
    Since every child has its own biological composition and grows up in different surroundings than another child, these factors might have an effect on the child’s motor competence development. For his reason, the <b>first subquestion</b> was established.
    <br><br>
    The <b>second subquestion</b> refers to the prediction models that are used in data science to predict on data. Thereby, the false negative rate refers to the number of children who are predicted as having a healthy and normal motor competence development, although these children are in fact having problems in that area. This prediction error needs to be very low or in the best-case scenario not present because it is always better to provide a child help even if he does not need it, other than not giving the actually needed help to the child who really is having problems with his development of his motor skills. Because of that, a prediction model has to be found that has the lowest false negative rate.
    <br><br>
    Finally, the <b>third subquestion</b> refers to characteristics that might be common in children that have problems in developing their motor skills. If these specific characteristics can be found, the detection of children in need of help might become faster and more efficient.</p>

  <summary>Evaluation</summary> 
    <p>Based on research that has been conducted regarding already existing projects with showing similarities towards this project and general research relating to the data science subject a pattern of proceedings of how such a project needs to be tackled has stood out. 
    Accordingly, the first step is gathering a large amount of data that can be used throughout the project. After gathering the data, it needs to be prepared before the actual use, so that it decreases the chance of falsifying the following predictions. Hence, the data must be explored first to gather an understanding of the given information. Then it needs to be cleaned, where exemplarily missing values have to be deleted, outliers removed and missing data, if needed, imputed and other. When all that is done, a prediction model has to be found that will apply to the subject the best and give most accurate predictions in the end. When the model is selected, it needs to be adjusted to the specific needs and therefore has to be configured and potentially receive hyperparameter tuning. Following the model needs to be trained and evaluated, in terms of its accuracy. This step has to be improved until the predictions are as accurate as possible.
    Correspondingly, these steps functioned as an outlook towards the question of in what direction our group needs to work to, in order to hopefully accomplishing the wanted results.

  <summary>Introduction of the Subject Field</summary> 
    <p>The first information given about the project <i>Motoric</i> was the project description. Which stated as follows: <br> <br><i>Within the Start(V)aardig project several information is gathered among more than 1700 young children. Actual motor competence, perceived motor competence, enjoyment, BMI, age, gender and several factors related to the parenting style are gathered at two different moments (T0 and T1). The assignment is to detect which variables predict a (long term) low and concerning level of motor competence in young children. If we are able to detect a certain ‘risk profile’ at an early stage we (BSC, PE teachers) can provide them appropriate interventions.</i><br><br>
    From this description only basic knowledge about the project and it's subject could have been gathered. Therefore, research was done to gain a better understanding of the topic and the given problem that needed to be solved.<br>
    First, it was interesting to know more about the organization <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a> to explore their specification in order to create a connection to why this particular problem statement arised and this project was started. <br>
    Therefore, within <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a>, this project was created in order to try to recognize difficulties in the motor skills development in a young child at a very young stage, so that possible following misdevelopments in the child's motor capabilities can - with a high chance - be prevented or at least better helped with, before it is too late and the child will need a great amount of help to correct and enhance their motor skills or cannot be really helped anymore to improve, but at least can be helped to slow down or stop the process of worsening. <br> 
    To gather more information on the topic of motor skills development in young children, more research has been conducted, resulting in the following findings, that are described and listed under the following point 'Background Research'.</p>
      <ul>
        <details>
          <summary>Background Research</summary>
          <p>During the background research about the topic of the motor skills development in young children, a basic idea the process of that development could be concluded, where the development of the gross motor skills was the main focus.<br>
          Therefore, at the age of two, a child for example be able to pick up objects from a standing position and not lose his balance, kick a ball, walk and run. At the age of three, shortly balancing and hopping on one foot, pedalling a tricycle and walking upstairs with switching feet, should not be a problem. When the child is four years old, it is expected that he can throw a ball overhand while coordinating that movement and in general show an enhanced balance contorl. At the age of five, coordinating the entire body, therefore hopping, jumping and skipping without losing balance, and keeping the balance while standing on one foot with both eyes closed, should not be a difficulty (<a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-lifespandevelopment/chapter/motor-skill-development/">Motor Skill Development</a>). As similarly when the child becomes six years old, he should be able to walk on a balance beam, hopping a good distance, run on toes, skip with the use of a skipping rope, throw and catch in a mature way and jump with mature control and skills (<a href="https://childdevelopment.com.au/resources/child-development-charts/gross-motor-developmental-chart/">Gross Motor Development Chart</a>).</p>

        <summary>Existing, Similar Projects</summary>
          <p>After gathering more background information on the subject of motor skills development in young children, related works, such as projects, were of interest to find. These, even if not dealing with the exact same problem statement can help getting a broder viewpoint on our own project and give us ideas of where and how to start.<br>
          Therefore, a search for such similar already existing projects was undertaken through which several findings have been made. These findings are listed under the point 'List of papers from existing projects'.<br><br>
          In most of the gathered studies, the children were between three and six years old, while some of the studies dealt with the gross and other with fine motor skills developed, and some with both of them.<br>
          For instance, a demonstration of a similarity to our study could be found in studies such as from <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methodshttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methods">Wang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://efsupit.ro/images/stories/3%20September2016/art%20175.pdf">Abdullah et al. (2016)</a>, in which children were tested with the help of different physical exercises in order to estimate their state of motor competence, just as in our study physical exercises were used as a testing method as well. The investigation of many different variables or rather features that characterize the children, their background and other related details, along with the importance of each individual feature, is another similarity between some of the existing studies and our project <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3345234">(Gilbert, 1980b; de Meester et al., 2020b)</a>. Further, in the study from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01336-2">Meester et al (2020c)</a>, a differentiation between perceived and actual motor competence was made and explored, which is also the case in our study, since perceived and actual motor competence are kept seperately. Studies like the ones from <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methodshttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methods">Wang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899107/">Zysset et al. (2018)</a> were of interest as well because they include and/or evaluate parental questionnaires or rather surveys, which are incorporated in our study too.<br>
          Some studies took different and rather technical approaches to conduct their reseach on the motor capabilities of young children. Such studies exemplarily developed and used a smart play device (<a href="https://digitallifecentre.nl/redactie/resources/finalpaperfinal.pdf">Sander et al, unknown</a>), smart toys (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b862/333190b6a202c1dd8c14ed8821ae3c3fb9a4.pdf">Martin-Ruiz et al., 2015</a>), sensor-augmented toys (<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e24237">Brons et al., 2021</a>) and a web-based application (<a href="http://journal.unj.ac.id/unj/index.php/jpud/article/view/10371">Chairilsyah, 2019</a>).<br><br>
          In conclusion, all of these studies give knowledge and an interesting insight into the motor skills development topic, while at the same time also provide a basic understanding in that sphere. This is of great use and help for our rather new study, which tackles to find a solution to a problem that has never been dealt with in any study before. Therefore, it was our challenge to find an answer to how to predict the motor skills development in young children.</p>

          <summary>Existing Datasets</summary>
          <p>Finding an exisiting dataset was not a necessity for this project because two datasets already existed, since the data had been gathered by <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a> and was given us to work with.<br> However, we did not receive those datasets immediately, for which reason I researched for existing similar datasets on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"><i>Kaggle</i></a>. During that research, I found one dataset that seemed to examine a similar topic. That particular dataset looks at the growth development from child- to adulthood, while several growth related measurements were taken, as well as information was gathered from the individual child's parents. I found that two of the taken measurements were about motor skills. Therefore, one of the measurements were the gross and the other the fine motor skills. <br>
          However, I decided against indulding deeper into this dataset because we soon received the first part of the first dataset from our project owner.</p>

          <summary>Data Collection</summary>
            <p>Since the data was given to us by StartVaardig through our project owner Pim Koolwijk, we did not have to collect the data ourselves. However, we received the data in bits, time after time, which meant that we had to put together the different data files every time new data arrived.
            <br>
            Unfortunately, the data files cannot be shared because the information contained in those files was trusted to our group by our project owner.</p>
            <p>Because the data that was given to us, had a rather small amount of participants that were in our targeted age group of four to six years old and contained complete information about them, we decided to search for fitting CBS data that might help us to gain a larger amount of data to be able to create rather accurate predictions later on. The CBS data we gathered contained information on core numbers, gender and age, income and the migration background. 
            <br>In the end however, we decided that the data would not be as useful to us in order to make good predictions, and since it did cause great problems while merging the datasets together, we decided to not use the CBS data afterall.</p>

  <summary>Explanation of Terminology, Jargon and Definitions</summary>
  <ul>
    <div><h4>Gross Motor Skills<h4></div>
    <p>These are physical skills that involve the entire body to be able to do tasks such as sit upright, walk, run, jump, as well as catching and throwing, just as kicking a ball, but also swim and ride a bike and others. Therefore these skills require the large muscles of the body that stabilise the core to work correctly, but at the same time need correct coordination between eyes and hand.</p>

    <div><h4>Perceived Motor Competence<h4></div>
    <p>Perceived motor competence is as the term already mentioned, the motor competence one thinks one has from one's own observation of one's body.</p>
    <br>
    <div><h4>Actual Motor Competence</h4></div>
    <p>Actual motor competence, in contrary to the perceived motor competence, is the motor competence that one actually has, which for example can be measure with the help of test that for instance are physical exercises.</p>

    <p>In the communication part of this project, I have held two internal and one external presentation, prepared and/or helped prepare the slides for the presentations, created the design and layout of the slides and Kahoot quiz for the learning lab. I also worked on the research paper and wrote parts of it, as well as proofread and gave feedback to the parts my teammates composed. Also, I was always physically present during all presentations to support my teammate(s), who was or were giving the presentation and to react towards questions or feedback from the audience, even if I was not the one giving the presentation.<br>
    Folliwing, my contributions to this part wil be described more precisely:</p>

<!-- DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE -->
<details>
  <summary>Domain Knowledge</summary>
  <p>The first information given about the project <i>Motoric</i> was the project description. Which stated as follows: <br> <br><i>Within the Start(V)aardig project several information is gathered among more than 1700 young children. Actual motor competence, perceived motor competence, enjoyment, BMI, age, gender and several factors related to the parenting style are gathered at two different moments (T0 and T1). The assignment is to detect which variables predict a (long term) low and concerning level of motor competence in young children. If we are able to detect a certain ‘risk profile’ at an early stage we (BSC, PE teachers) can provide them appropriate interventions.</i><br><br>
  From this description only basic knowledge about the project and it's subject could have been gathered. Therefore, research was done to gain a better understanding of the topic and the given problem that needed to be solved.<br>
  First, it was interesting to know more about the organization <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a> to explore their specification in order to create a connection to why this particular problem statement arised and this project was started. <br>
  Therefore, within <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a>, this project was created in order to try to recognize difficulties in the motor skills development in a young child at a very young stage, so that possible following misdevelopments in the child's motor capabilities can - with a high chance - be prevented or at least better helped with, before it is too late and the child will need a great amount of help to correct and enhance their motor skills or cannot be really helped anymore to improve, but at least can be helped to slow down or stop the process of worsening. <br> 
  To gather more information on the topic of motor skills development in young children, more research has been conducted, resulting in the following findings, that are described and listed under the following point 'Background Research'.      
  </p>
    <ul>
    <details>
          <summary>Background Research</summary>
          <p>During the background research about the topic of the motor skills development in young children, a basic idea the process of that development could be concluded, where the development of the gross motor skills was the main focus.<br>
          Therefore, at the age of two, a child for example be able to pick up objects from a standing position and not lose his balance, kick a ball, walk and run. At the age of three, shortly balancing and hopping on one foot, pedalling a tricycle and walking upstairs with switching feet, should not be a problem. When the child is four years old, it is expected that he can throw a ball overhand while coordinating that movement and in general show an enhanced balance contorl. At the age of five, coordinating the entire body, therefore hopping, jumping and skipping without losing balance, and keeping the balance while standing on one foot with both eyes closed, should not be a difficulty (<a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-lifespandevelopment/chapter/motor-skill-development/">Motor Skill Development</a>). As similarly when the child becomes six years old, he should be able to walk on a balance beam, hopping a good distance, run on toes, skip with the use of a skipping rope, throw and catch in a mature way and jump with mature control and skills (<a href="https://childdevelopment.com.au/resources/child-development-charts/gross-motor-developmental-chart/">Gross Motor Development Chart</a>).</p>

          <summary>Existing, Similar Projects</summary>
          <p>After gathering more background information on the subject of motor skills development in young children, related works, such as projects, were of interest to find. These, even if not dealing with the exact same problem statement can help getting a broder viewpoint on our own project and give us ideas of where and how to start.<br>
          Therefore, a search for such similar already existing projects was undertaken through which several findings have been made. These findings are listed under the point 'List of papers from existing projects'.<br><br>
          In most of the gathered studies, the children were between three and six years old, while some of the studies dealt with the gross and other with fine motor skills developed, and some with both of them.<br>
          For instance, a demonstration of a similarity to our study could be found in studies such as from <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methodshttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methods">Wang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://efsupit.ro/images/stories/3%20September2016/art%20175.pdf">Abdullah et al. (2016)</a>, in which children were tested with the help of different physical exercises in order to estimate their state of motor competence, just as in our study physical exercises were used as a testing method as well. The investigation of many different variables or rather features that characterize the children, their background and other related details, along with the importance of each individual feature, is another similarity between some of the existing studies and our project <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3345234">(Gilbert, 1980b; de Meester et al., 2020b)</a>. Further, in the study from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01336-2">Meester et al (2020c)</a>, a differentiation between perceived and actual motor competence was made and explored, which is also the case in our study, since perceived and actual motor competence are kept seperately. Studies like the ones from <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methodshttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/6639341/#methods">Wang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899107/">Zysset et al. (2018)</a> were of interest as well because they include and/or evaluate parental questionnaires or rather surveys, which are incorporated in our study too.<br>
          Some studies took different and rather technical approaches to conduct their reseach on the motor capabilities of young children. Such studies exemplarily developed and used a smart play device (<a href="https://digitallifecentre.nl/redactie/resources/finalpaperfinal.pdf">Sander et al, unknown</a>), smart toys (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b862/333190b6a202c1dd8c14ed8821ae3c3fb9a4.pdf">Martin-Ruiz et al., 2015</a>), sensor-augmented toys (<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e24237">Brons et al., 2021</a>) and a web-based application (<a href="http://journal.unj.ac.id/unj/index.php/jpud/article/view/10371">Chairilsyah, 2019</a>).<br><br>
          In conclusion, all of these studies give knowledge and an interesting insight into the motor skills development topic, while at the same time also provide a basic understanding in that sphere. This is of great use and help for our rather new study, which tackles to find a solution to a problem that has never been dealt with in any study before. Therefore, it was our challenge to find an answer to how to predict the motor skills development in young children.</p>

          <summary>Existing Datasets</summary>
          <p>Finding an exisiting dataset was not a necessity for this project because two datasets already existed, since the data had been gathered by <a href="https://www.allesoversport.nl/startvaardig/"><i>Start(V)aardig</i></a> and was given us to work with.<br> However, we did not receive those datasets immediately, for which reason I researched for existing similar datasets on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"><i>Kaggle</i></a>. During that research, I found one dataset that seemed to examine a similar topic. That particular dataset looks at the growth development from child- to adulthood, while several growth related measurements were taken, as well as information was gathered from the individual child's parents. I found that two of the taken measurements were about motor skills. Therefore, one of the measurements were the gross and the other the fine motor skills. <br>
          However, I decided against indulding deeper into this dataset because we soon received the first part of the first dataset from our project owner.</p>

<!-- DATA COLLECTION -->
<details>
  <summary>Data Collection</summary>
    <p>Since the data was given to us by StartVaardig through our project owner Pim Koolwijk, we did not have to collect the data ourselves. However, we received the data in bits, time after time, which meant that we had to put together the different data files every time new data arrived.
    <br>
    Unfortunately, the data files cannot be shared because the information contained in those files was trusted to our group by our project owner.</p>
    <p>Because the data that was given to us, had a rather small amount of participants that were in our targeted age group of four to six years old and contained complete information about them, we decided to search for fitting CBS data that might help us to gain a larger amount of data to be able to create rather accurate predictions later on. The CBS data we gathered contained information on core numbers, gender and age, income and the migration background. 
    <br>In the end however, we decided that the data would not be as useful to us in order to make good predictions, and since it did cause great problems while merging the datasets together, we decided to not use the CBS data afterall.</p>

  <summary>Communication</summary>
    <p>In the communication part of this project, I have held two internal and one external presentation, prepared and/or helped prepare the slides for the presentations, created the design and layout of the slides and Kahoot quiz for the learning lab. I also worked on the research paper and wrote parts of it, as well as proofread and gave feedback to the parts my teammates composed. Also, I was always physically present during all presentations to support my teammate(s), who was or were giving the presentation and to react towards questions or feedback from the audience, even if I was not the one giving the presentation.<br>
    Folliwing, my contributions to this part wil be described more precisely:</p>
    <ul>
      <details>
        <summary>Internal Presentations</summary>
          <a href="/Presentations/Internal Presentations/InternalPresentation_1_TeamMotoric.pdf">Internal Presentation 1</a>
          <p>While my teammates and I created the slides together, I held the first internal presenation on my own.<br>
          When creating the slides, we sat together as a group and discussed the design, layout and content for each of the created slides.</p>
          <br>
          <a href="/Presentations/Internal Presentations/InternalPresentation_4_TeamMotoric.pdf">Internal Presentation 4</a>
          <p>For the fourth internal presentation I helped with preparing the slides, while especially focussing on the content, but also design and layout. This has been done together with some of my teammates, who I discussed these matters with.</p>
          <br>
          <a href="/Presentations/Internal Presentations/InternalPresentation_6_TeamMotoric.pdf">Internal Presentation 6</a>
          <p>I also helped preparing the sixth internal presentation, in which I again focused especially focused on the content, but also checked for errors in the design and layout. And as it has been done in the previous presentations, some of my teammates and I talked about every of these topics together and decided on the results together.</p>
          <br>
          <a href="/Presentations/Internal Presentations/InternalPresentation_7_TeamMotoric.pdf">Internal Presentation 7</a>
          <p>The seventh internal presentation I was unfortunately not able to help to prepare the slides, but instead I presented it on my own.</p>
          <br>
          <a href="/Presentations/Internal Presentations/InternalPresentation_8_TeamMotoric.pdf">Internal Presentation 8</a>
          <p>For the eighth and final internal presentation, I prepared the slides on my own, however slight changes might have been undertaken by the teammate that held this presentation.</p>
          <br>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>External Presentations</summary>
          <a href="/Presentations/External Presentations/ExternalPresentation_2_TeamMotoric.pdf">External Presentation 2</a>
          <p>The sencond external presentation was prepared by my teammates, however Pascal and I presented it. I held the presentation from the beginning until the slide number six.</p>
          <br>
          <a href="/Presentations/External Presentations/ExternalPresentation_3_TeamMotoric.pdf">External Presentation 3</a>
          <p>Using the design and layout from the slides I designed for the learning lab, Lisa and I created the slides for the third external presentation together. For that, we went through every slide together and discuss it's contents as well as design and layout. This presentation also included the <a href="/User Interface Wireframes/UserInterface_Wireframes_Idea.pdf">prototype of wireframes for a possible user interface</a> for our prediction model tool, which I created.</p>
          <br>

        <summary>Learning Lab</summary>
          <a href="/Presentations/Learning Lab/LearningLab_DesignAndLayout_TeamMotoric.pdf">Learning Lab Design & Layout</a>
          <p>Although I did not present the learning lab, I contributed to it by preparing the slides for it, which means I created the complete design and layout, as well as gave some input on possible content ideas and placements.</p>
          <br>
          <div><h4>Kahoot Quiz<h4></div>
          <p>Additionally, Lisa and I prepared the Kahoot Quiz for the learning lab in order to involve the audience directly in our presentation. Further we intended the quiz to be simple, though slightly tricky, but at the same time fun. <br> Following are screenshots of the Kahoot Quiz:</p>
